# NoTankControls

NeosVR disables the joystick if you have a tooltip equipped which makes use of the "Secondary" action (pressing down on that same joystick.)
This mod removes that restriction, allowing tools to be equipped while keeping full movement intact.

To install, [download NoTankControls.dll](https://github.com/furrz/NoTankControls/releases/latest/NoTankControls.dll) and place it in your nml_mods folder.
